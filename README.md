# Neovim Configuration
I tend to switch text editors often, but I find myself coming back to neovim a lot.  
So, I decided to suck it up and stop using AstroNvim and make my own neovim config.  
It was surpisingly easy, so here it is.  

# Note
I licensed this under BSD Clause Zero, so feel free to take this config, no need to credit me.  
I don't think you'd even want to credit me. :skull:
